- Piphillan_output contains raw output from secondGenome program Piphillan that does a nearest neighbor approximation to infer KEGG ortholog per taxanomic unit

- ko_abund_table_normByPathway.Rds is a KO abundance by Sample table, showing the KO counts to be found in every sample. Each KO abundance has been divided by the number of pathways it participates in 

- pathways_gsea.rds: a list named by pathway that gives the name of each KO that participates in that pathway

- Any file with title  *ko--- contains a .tsv file that reports which biomarker (from tableA) a specific KO was found in. extracting_KOs_specific_to_ESVs.R produces those tables

-pvalue_plotting.R is a utility script to create pathway enrichment plots for paper 

-pathway_enrichment.R : actually run the differential pathway enrichment test(GSEA) using ko_abund_table_normByPathway.Rds and pathways_gsea.rds
